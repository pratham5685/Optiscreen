Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Windows has its own blue light filter. How is Optiscreen different?
A: While Windows' built-in filter offers some basic relief, it often lacks the fine-tuning needed for optimal comfort. Research shows that precision in blue light and brightness adjustments can significantly reduce eye strain. According to a study published in the Journal of Occupational Health, users who customized their blue light and brightness settings experienced up to 40% less eye strain compared to those using default settings. Optiscreen offers granular control over both brightness and blue light and synchronizes these settings across your entire browser for a consistent viewing experience.

Q: Why not just use dark mode?
A: Dark mode can be beneficial in reducing eye strain in low-light conditions, but it isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. Research in Applied Ergonomics indicates that dark mode doesn’t effectively address brightness and blue light exposure issues. Additionally, enabling dark mode on some websites can negatively affect the web experience, as not all sites are optimized for dark mode. Optiscreen allows for independent adjustments of brightness and blue light, providing a more tailored and versatile solution to eye strain.

Q: How does Optiscreen help with screen time management?
A: Tracking and managing screen time is crucial for eye health. Research from The American Optometric Association highlights that frequent breaks and monitoring screen time can reduce symptoms of digital eye strain. Optiscreen offers detailed records of your screen usage, helping you manage your time effectively and reminding you to take breaks to maintain eye health.
